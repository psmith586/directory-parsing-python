test documentation:

-libraries used: os, matplotlib (as plt)

-path and keyword based on user input (if using 'copy as path' remove quotations)

-test directory included in filewalker folder (testdir path was used for testing/keyword = ribeye)

-test method: 
	
	- created test directory and subdirectories each containing either positive test files (file name and contents
		containing keyword) or negative test folders (do not contain one or both of positive criteria)
	
	- intended results using testdir: 6 total positive test files, testdir: 1, sub1: 2, sub2: 3
	
	-graph should reflect above results


- possible improvements:  robust input verification, try/except catch statements to ensure directories/files exist, 
	utilize other available python libraries to optimize code
